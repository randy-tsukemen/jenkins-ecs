# Jenkins on AWS ECS: High-Scale Deployment Guide

## Handling 1000 Concurrent Jobs

This document outlines best practices for deploying Jenkins on AWS with Amazon ECS to handle a high-scale workload of 1000 concurrent jobs.

## Architecture Overview

### Key Components

- **Jenkins Controller**: Deployed as an ECS service with persistent storage via EFS
- **Jenkins Agents**: Dynamic ECS-based agents spawned on-demand
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: For handling the 1000 concurrent job requirement
- **Application Load Balancer**: For distributing traffic
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: For storing credentials securely
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and alerting

## Infrastructure as Code

All components should be defined using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools:

- AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for AWS resources
- AWS CDK for more complex deployments

## Jenkins Controller Configuration

### ECS Task Definition

```yaml
TaskDefinition:
  Type: AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition
  Properties:
    Family: jenkins-controller
    Cpu: "4096" # 4 vCPU
    Memory: "16384" # 16GB
    NetworkMode: awsvpc
    ExecutionRoleArn: !GetAtt JenkinsExecutionRole.Arn
    TaskRoleArn: !GetAtt JenkinsTaskRole.Arn
    ContainerDefinitions:
      - Name: jenkins
        Image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
        Essential: true
        PortMappings:
          - ContainerPort: 8080
          - ContainerPort: 50000 # Agent connection port
        MountPoints:
          - SourceVolume: jenkins-home
            ContainerPath: /var/jenkins_home
        LogConfiguration:
          LogDriver: awslogs
          Options:
            awslogs-group: !Ref JenkinsLogGroup
            awslogs-region: !Ref AWS::Region
            awslogs-stream-prefix: jenkins
    Volumes:
      - Name: jenkins-home
        EFSVolumeConfiguration:
          FilesystemId: !Ref JenkinsEFSFileSystem
          TransitEncryption: ENABLED
```

### Persistent Storage with EFS

- Use Amazon EFS for `/var/jenkins_home` to ensure data persistence
- Enable EFS encryption at rest
- Use lifecycle policies to manage backups

## Jenkins Agent Scaling Strategy

### ECS Cluster Configuration

```yaml
ECSCluster:
  Type: AWS::ECS::Cluster
  Properties:
    ClusterName: jenkins-agent-cluster
    CapacityProviders:
      - FARGATE
      - FARGATE_SPOT
    DefaultCapacityProviderStrategy:
      - CapacityProvider: FARGATE_SPOT
        Weight: 3
      - CapacityProvider: FARGATE
        Weight: 1
```

### Agent Configurations

1. **Instance Distribution**:

   - 70% Spot Instances (cost optimization)
   - 30% On-Demand Instances (reliability for critical jobs)

2. **Agent Classes**:

   - Small: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM (for lightweight jobs)
   - Medium: 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM (for typical jobs)
   - Large: 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM (for resource-intensive jobs)
   - GPU: For specialized workloads requiring GPU acceleration

3. **Auto-Scaling Configuration**:
   - Scale based on Jenkins queue depth
   - CloudWatch alarms to trigger scaling policies

## Network Architecture

1. **VPC Configuration**:

   - Minimum of 3 Availability Zones for high availability
   - Private subnets for Jenkins controller and agents
   - Public subnets for the ALB only
   - NAT gateways for outbound connectivity

2. **Security Group Configuration**:
   - Least privilege access controls
   - Separate security groups for controller and agents
   - Allow only necessary ports (8080, 50000)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Jenkins Controller**:

   - Offload builds to agents, keep controller focused on orchestration
   - JVM tuning: `-Xmx12g -Xms12g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent`
   - Periodic garbage collection triggers

2. **Pipeline Optimizations**:

   - Use parallel stages for complex pipelines
   - Implement timeout strategies to prevent stuck jobs
   - Prune workspace after builds

3. **Plugin Management**:
   - Only install essential plugins
   - Regular updates but carefully tested
   - Avoid heavy UI plugins that impact controller performance

## Essential Plugins for Scale

1. **Job Management**:

   - Job DSL / Pipeline
   - Folders Plugin
   - Configuration as Code (JCasC)

2. **Agent Management**:

   - Amazon ECS Plugin
   - EC2 Fleet Plugin (alternative)
   - Node and Label Parameter Plugin

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Throttle Concurrent Builds Plugin
   - Priority Sorter Plugin
   - Job Load Statistics Plugin

## Distributed Builds Strategy

1. **Job Distribution Strategy**:

   - Label-based routing to appropriate agent types
   - Resource allocation based on job requirements
   - Priority-based scheduling for critical jobs

2. **Agent Provisioning Settings**:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
     agent {
       ecs {
         inheritFrom 'jenkins-agent'
         cpu 2048
         memory 4096
         subnets 'subnet-private-1,subnet-private-2,subnet-private-3'
         securityGroups 'sg-agent'
         assignPublicIp false
       }
     }
     stages {
       // Pipeline stages
     }
   }
   ```

## High Availability Setup

1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**:

   - Controller runs across multiple AZs
   - Agent instances distributed across AZs

2. **Disaster Recovery**:

   - Regular EFS snapshots
   - Jenkins configuration backups
   - Automated restoration procedures

3. **Load Balancing**:
   - ALB for Jenkins UI access
   - Network Load Balancer for agent connectivity

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **CloudWatch Dashboards**:

   - ECS service metrics
   - Jenkins metrics (via CloudWatch agent)
   - Queue depth and build duration metrics

2. **Alerting**:

   - Queue depth exceeding thresholds
   - Controller health checks
   - Resource utilization alarms

3. **Logging**:
   - Centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs
   - Log retention policies
   - Build log rotation

## Cost Optimization

1. **Compute Strategy**:

   - Leverage Spot Instances for agents (up to 70%)
   - Graviton2 instances for better price/performance
   - Fargate for simpler operational model

2. **Scaling Policies**:

   - Scale to zero for agent clusters during off-hours
   - Schedule-based scaling for predictable workloads
   - Reserved Instances for baseline capacity

3. **Storage Optimization**:
   - EFS lifecycle policies
   - Workspace cleanup policies
   - Artifact retention policies

## Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:

   - AWS IAM integration
   - OIDC integration (Okta, Google, etc.)
   - Role-based access control

2. **Network Security**:

   - VPC endpoint for AWS services
   - Security groups with least privilege
   - Network traffic encryption

3. **Secrets Management**:
   - AWS Secrets Manager integration
   - Credential rotation
   - No hardcoded secrets in pipelines

## Deployment Steps

1. **Initial Setup**:

   - Deploy VPC and network infrastructure
   - Create EFS file system
   - Configure security groups

2. **Jenkins Controller Deployment**:

   - Create ECS task definition
   - Deploy controller service

## Maintenance Procedures

1. **Upgrades**:

   - Blue/green deployment for controller updates
   - Canary testing for plugin updates
   - Rollback procedures

2. **Backup and Restore**:

   - Automated EFS backups
   - Configuration backups
   - Disaster recovery testing

3. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   - Regular performance reviews
   - Scaling adjustment based on usage patterns
   - Cost analysis and optimization
